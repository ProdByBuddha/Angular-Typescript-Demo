# Angular-Typescript-Demo

This README file summarizes my experience and key learnings from building an Angular app.

## Overview

I embarked on a journey to build an Angular app, covering the fundamentals and diving deep into the application building process.

## Key Learnings

1. **Standalone Components and Inputs**: I learned about standalone components and inputs, which are fundamental building blocks in Angular.

2. **Angular Templates and Data Binding**: I explored how to use Angular templates and data binding. This included one-way data binding for read-only data and two-way data binding for updating a model.

3. **Event Binding**: I learned how to bind component methods to user events, like keystrokes and clicks.

4. **Selection and Editing**: I enabled users to select a hero from a list and edit that hero in the details view.

5. **Routing**: I learned how to use routing to navigate among different views and their components.

6. **Building a Template-Driven Form**: I created a template-driven form. The control elements in the form are bound to data properties that have input validation.

## Conclusion

My journey with Angular provided a comprehensive understanding of the framework, covering a wide range of topics from components and inputs to data binding, event binding, routing, and more. It was a great experience and I look forward to building more applications with Angular.
